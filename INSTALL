Since the code is small, it has been decided to keep the object and executable files
in the same place as the source files : in src/ and not a seperate obj/ folder.

To install, go to src/ and type make.

Please make sure to use the executables inside their respective folders client and server
so that the exchange of data is done in between these to folders without touching to the 
source files. To enforce this rule, do not hesitate to create symbolic links in each
folder to the appropriate executable : 

    $ cd client
    $ ln -s ../src/client client

    $ cd server
    $ ln -s ../src/serveur serveur
