1. Error handling : client side, no exit from connection when exit from file handling error. NOT GOOD. 
 We should have  in CheckError() the possibility of changing the choice (and perhaps sending the choice)
 in order to close connection properly.

2. File handling : at the moment, we store the full file in a single go. NOT GOOD. If the file is heavy,
 then that would mean having a file_content variable quite sizable, and enough to eat too much memory. Same
 would happen on the server's side. Solution : send the file content by pieces (preferably of multiples of 1448
 bytes to avoid un-necessary padding), and read and store by pieces. This requires :
        - a ReadFile() function with input parameter the size of the block to read + position of lecture.
        - a seperate SizeFile() function to get the size of the file seperatly from the reading
        - a WriteFile() function with input parameter the size of the block to write, and the writing options
            ( wb only at the start to squash any existing file, then ab to add content at the end.)

3. Error handling : at the moment, only errors on file handling. NOT GOOD. We need error checks at the start
of each sent/recieved messages.
 
4. No endianess handling. We suppose client and server share the same convention

5. No sizeof(int) checks. We suppose int is always of size 4. Might apparently not always be the case.

6. No checks if the file to be transfered already exists in destination. There is no warning, if the file
exists, it is systematically crushed.

7. The document in the server can only be stored where the exe server is. We should ask for a destination path
    and check if it exists with the server. If exits => continue. If not, server's side : send error code & next
     information to read : choice. Client's side : send path, read recieved error. If ok, continue. If nok, break.

8. Use allocated memory for file system. And better printing !

9. Replace scanf by fgets to control size of input string.

10. Display more than first existing files in current repertory. Which means that the client must search a different way
the existences of the file name it wants to retrieve.
